      "title": "How RVS was born?",
      "part1": "My name is Roman Shahalevich, and my journey in the construction industry began long before I thought about my own business. As a student, I spent a lot of time helping my father in the family construction company. If someone had told me then that one day I would continue the family business and even open my own company, I probably wouldn't have believed it.",
      "part2": "But life itself shows us the right path. Years of working shoulder to shoulder with my father gave me invaluable experience - both theoretical and practical. I learned not only to operate equipment or manage processes but also to understand people, find solutions in difficult situations, and ensure that clients are always satisfied with the result.",
      "part3": "Over time, I felt ready to take a decisive step - to create my own company based on the values I learned from my father. That's how RVS was born - my 'pride' and, you could say, my 'child'.",
      "part4": "Years of working with various clients - from large companies to individuals - have taught me an important truth: success in this business is not just about providing services or making deals. It is, first and foremost, about building trusting and long-term relationships based on respect and honesty.",
      "part5": "Some of my first clients have over time become not just regular customers but also reliable partners, sometimes even friends. I believe that this is what distinguishes RVS - a company built not only on a solid foundation of knowledge and experience but also on sincere relationships with those for whom we work.",
      "part6": "At RVS, we build not only buildings - we create relationships that stand the test of time."
